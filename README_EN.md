### Docker Container

<ol>
<li>Get the image</li>
<ul>
<li>Method 1: Build the image using the <code>Dockerfile</code>.</li>
<li>Method 2: Pull the image using the command <code>docker pull joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code>.</li>
<li>Method 3: Pull the image using the command <code>docker pull ghcr.io/joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Create the container: <code>docker run --name ContainerName(optional) -p HostPort:5555 -v tiktok_downloader_volume:/app/Volume -it &lt;image name&gt;</code>.</li>
<br><b>Note:</b> The <code>&lt;image name&gt;</code> here must be consistent with the image name you used in the first step (<code>joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code> or <code>ghcr.io/joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code>)
<li>Run the container
<ul>
<li>Start the container: <code>docker start -i container name/container ID</code>.</li>
<li>Restart the container: <code>docker restart -i container name/container ID</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Docker containers cannot directly access the host machine's file system, and some features may be unavailable, for example: <code>Get Cookie from Browser</code>; if there are any other issues, please report!</p>
<hr>

## About Cookie

[Click to view Cookie tutorial](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/blob/master/docs/Cookie%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B.md)

> * Cookie only needs to be re-written to the configuration file after it expires, and not every time the program is
    run.
>
> * The Cookie can affect the resolution of the video files downloaded from the DouYin platform. If you are unable to
    download high-resolution video files, please try updating the Cookie!
>
> * When the program fails to obtain data, you can try updating the Cookie or using a Cookie that is already logged in!

<hr>

## Other Instructions

<ul>
<li>When the program prompts the user for input, pressing Enter directly will return to the previous menu, and inputting <code>Q</code> or <code>q</code> will end the program's execution.</li>
<li>Since fetching data for liked and favorites works of an account only returns the publication dates of those works, not the dates of the actions (liking or favouring), the program needs to retrieve all liked and favorites works data before performing date filtering. If there are a large number of works, this may take a considerable amount of time. The number of requests can be controlled via the <code>max_pages</code> parameter.</li>
<li>To obtain data for posts made by a private account, a logged-in Cookie is required, and the logged-in account must follow the private account.</li>
<li>When batch downloading account posts works or mix works, if the corresponding nickname or mark parameter changes, the program will automatically update the nickname and mark parameter in the file names of the downloaded works.</li>
<li>When downloading files, the program first downloads them to a temporary folder and then moves them to the storage folder upon completion. The temporary folder will be emptied when the program ends.</li>
<li>The <code>Batch Download Favorites Works Mode</code> currently only supports downloading Favorites works for the account corresponding to the currently logged-in Cookie and does not support multiple accounts.</li>
<li>If you want the program to use a proxy to request data, you must set the <code>proxy</code> parameter in <code>settings.json</code>; otherwise, the program will not use a proxy.</li>
<li>If your computer does not have a suitable program for editing JSON files, we recommend using the <a href="https://try8.cn/tool/format/json">JSON Online Tool</a> to edit the configuration file content.</li>
<li>When the program prompts the user to input content or links, please be careful to avoid including newline characters, as this may cause unexpected issues.</li>
<li>This project does not support downloading paid works. Please do not report any issues related to downloading paid works.</li>
<li>On Windows systems, the program needs to be run as an administrator to read Cookies from Chromium, Chrome, and Edge browsers.</li>
<li>This project has not been optimized for running multiple instances of the program. If you need to run multiple instances, please copy the entire project folder to avoid unexpected issues.</li>
<li>During program execution, if you need to terminate the program or <code>ffmpeg</code>, please press <code>Ctrl + C</code> to stop the process. Do not click the close button on the terminal window directly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Build of Executable File Guide</h2>
<details>
<summary>Build of Executable File Guide (Click to Expand)</summary>

This guide will walk you through forking this repository and executing GitHub Actions to automatically build and package
the program based on the latest source code!

---

### Steps to Use

#### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the project repository to fork it to your personal GitHub account
2. Your forked repository address will look like this: `https://github.com/your-username/this-repo`

---

#### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to the page of your forked repository
2. Click the **Settings** tab at the top
3. Click the **Actions** tab on the right
4. Click the **General** option
5. Under **Actions permissions**, select **Allow all actions and reusable workflows** and click the **Save** button

---

#### 3. Manually Trigger the Build Process

1. In your forked repository, click the **Actions** tab at the top
2. Find the workflow named **ÊûÑÂª∫ÂèØÊâßË°åÊñá‰ª∂**
3. Click the **Run workflow** button on the right:
    - Select the **master** or **develop** branch
    - Click **Run workflow**

---

#### 4. Check the Build Progress

1. On the **Actions** page, you can see the execution records of the triggered workflow
2. Click on the run record to view detailed logs to check the build progress and status

---

#### 5. Download the Build Result

1. Once the build is complete, go to the corresponding run record page
2. In the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the page, you will see the built result file
3. Click to download and save it to your local machine to get the built program

---

### Notes

1. **Resource Usage**:
    - GitHub provides free build environments for Actions, with a monthly usage limit (2000 minutes) for free-tier
      users

2. **Code Modifications**:
    - You are free to modify the code in your forked repository to customize the build process
    - After making changes, you can trigger the build process again to get your customized version

3. **Stay in Sync with the Main Repository**:
    - If the main repository is updated with new code or workflows, it is recommended that you periodically sync your
      forked repository to get the latest features and fixes

---

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q1: Why can't I trigger the workflow?

A: Please ensure that you have followed the steps to **Enable Actions**. Otherwise, GitHub will prevent the workflow
from running

#### Q2: What should I do if the build process fails?

A:

- Check the run logs to understand the cause of the failure
- Ensure there are no syntax errors or dependency issues in the code
- If the problem persists, please open an issue on
  the [Issues page](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/issues)

#### Q3: Can I directly use the Actions from the main repository?

A: Due to permission restrictions, you cannot directly trigger Actions from the main repository. Please use the forked
repository to execute the build process

</details>

## Program Update

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Download and extract the files, then copy the old version of the <code>_internal\Volume</code> folder into the new version's <code>_internal</code> folder.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Download and extract the files (do not run the program), then copy all files and directly overwrite the old version.</p>
